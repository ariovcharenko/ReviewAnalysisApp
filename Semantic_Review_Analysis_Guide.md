---

## ðŸ”¹ 3. Application Functionality

### Overview of the Semantic Analysis Process

The application processes reviews through several stages of analysis:

#### 1. Preprocessing

- **Tokenization**: Breaking text into individual words or tokens
  ```python
  # Using SpaCy for tokenization
  doc = nlp(text)
  tokens = [token.text for token in doc]
  ```

- **Stopword Removal**: Filtering out common words that don't add meaning
  ```python
  # SpaCy automatically identifies stopwords
  meaningful_tokens = [token.text for token in doc if not token.is_stop]
  ```

#### 2. Aspect Extraction

- **Using SpaCy**: Identifying product-related nouns and noun phrases
  ```python
  # Extract noun phrases as potential aspects
  noun_phrases = [chunk.text.lower() for chunk in doc.noun_chunks]
  
  # Extract nouns as potential aspects
  nouns = [token.text.lower() for token in doc if token.pos_ == "NOUN"]
  ```

- **Matching with Common Aspects**: Comparing extracted terms with a predefined list of product aspects
  ```python
  # Common product aspects to look for
  common_aspects = ["battery", "screen", "camera", "design", ...]
  
  # Match extracted terms with common aspects
  matched_aspects = {}
  for aspect in common_aspects:
      if aspect in extracted_terms:
          matched_aspects[aspect] = aspect
  ```

#### 3. Sentiment Analysis

- **Using BERT Models**: Analyzing the sentiment of the entire review and each aspect
  ```python
  # Tokenize text for BERT
  inputs = tokenizer(text, return_tensors="pt", truncation=True, max_length=512)
  
  # Get model prediction
  with torch.no_grad():
      outputs = model(**inputs)
      logits = outputs.logits
      probabilities = torch.nn.functional.softmax(logits, dim=1)
  
  # Convert to sentiment score between -1 and 1
  sentiment_score = (2 * probs[1] - 1)  # Maps [0,1] to [-1,1]
  ```

- **Sentiment Classification**: Categorizing sentiment as positive, neutral, or negative
  ```python
  if sentiment_score > 0.3:
      sentiment_label = "positive"
  elif sentiment_score < -0.3:
      sentiment_label = "negative"
  else:
      sentiment_label = "neutral"
  ```

#### 4. Summarization

- **Using T5 Transformer**: Generating a concise summary of the review
  ```python
  # Preprocess text for T5
  text = "summarize: " + text.strip()
  
  # Tokenize and generate summary
  inputs = tokenizer(text, return_tensors="pt", max_length=512, truncation=True)
  output = model.generate(**inputs, max_length=150, num_beams=4, early_stopping=True)
  
  # Decode summary
  summary = tokenizer.decode(output[0], skip_special_tokens=True)
  ```

#### 5. Fake Review Detection

- **Sentiment Mismatch**: Comparing the numerical rating with the detected sentiment
  ```python
  # Example logic for detecting sentiment mismatch
  def detect_fake_review(text, rating):
      sentiment_result = sentiment_service.analyze_sentiment(text)
      sentiment_score = sentiment_result["sentiment_score"]
      
      # Check for mismatch between rating and sentiment
      if rating <= 2 and sentiment_score > 0.3:  # Low rating but positive text
          return True, "Sentiment mismatch: Low rating with positive text"
      elif rating >= 4 and sentiment_score < -0.3:  # High rating but negative text
          return True, "Sentiment mismatch: High rating with negative text"
      
      return False, None
  ```

- **Repeated Phrases**: Identifying suspicious patterns in the text
  ```python
  # Example logic for detecting repeated phrases
  def detect_repeated_phrases(text):
      # Tokenize into sentences
      sentences = [sent.text for sent in nlp(text).sents]
      
      # Check for repeated phrases
      phrases = {}
      for sentence in sentences:
          if sentence in phrases:
              phrases[sentence] += 1
          else:
              phrases[sentence] = 1
      
      # If any phrase is repeated more than once, flag as suspicious
      repeated = [phrase for phrase, count in phrases.items() if count > 1]
      if repeated:
          return True, f"Repeated phrases detected: {repeated}"
      
      return False, None
  ```

#### 6. Random Input Handling

- **Aspect Detection**: Checking if the text contains any product-related aspects
  ```python
  # Example logic for detecting irrelevant text
  def is_relevant_review(text):
      aspects = aspect_service.extract_aspects(text)
      
      if not aspects:
          return False, "Your review seems irrelevant. Please provide meaningful feedback."
      
      return True, None
  ```

- **Response Generation**: Providing appropriate feedback for irrelevant inputs
  ```python
  # Example API endpoint implementation
  @router.post("/analyze")
  def analyze_review(request: ReviewRequest):
      is_relevant, message = is_relevant_review(request.text)
      
      if not is_relevant:
          return {"error": message}
      
      # Proceed with normal analysis...
  ```

### Data Flow

1. **User submits a review** through the frontend interface
2. **Backend receives the review** and stores it in the database
3. **Sentiment analysis** is performed on the entire review
4. **Aspect extraction** identifies product features mentioned in the review
5. **Aspect sentiment analysis** determines the sentiment for each aspect
6. **Summarization** generates a concise version of the review
7. **Results are stored** in the database and returned to the frontend
8. **Frontend displays the results** in a user-friendly format

---

## ðŸ”¹ 4. Database Details

### Database System

The application uses **SQLite** for data storage, which is a lightweight, file-based database system. In a production environment, this could be replaced with PostgreSQL for better performance and scalability.

### Database Schema

The database consists of the following tables:

#### 1. Reviews Table

```sql
CREATE TABLE reviews (
    id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY AUTOINCREMENT,
    text TEXT NOT NULL,
    rating FLOAT,
    source VARCHAR(255),
    created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP
);
```

#### 2. Sentiment Analyses Table

```sql
CREATE TABLE sentiment_analyses (
    id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY AUTOINCREMENT,
    review_id INTEGER REFERENCES reviews(id),
    sentiment_score FLOAT NOT NULL,
    sentiment_label VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL,
    confidence FLOAT NOT NULL,
    created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP
);
```

#### 3. Aspect Analyses Table

```sql
CREATE TABLE aspect_analyses (
    id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY AUTOINCREMENT,
    review_id INTEGER REFERENCES reviews(id),
    aspect VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
    sentiment_score FLOAT NOT NULL,
    sentiment_label VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL,
    confidence FLOAT NOT NULL,
    relevant_text TEXT,
    created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP
);
```

#### 4. Review Summaries Table

```sql
CREATE TABLE review_summaries (
    id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY AUTOINCREMENT,
    review_id INTEGER REFERENCES reviews(id),
    summary_text TEXT NOT NULL,
    created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP
);
```

#### 5. Review Trends Table

```sql
CREATE TABLE review_trends (
    id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY AUTOINCREMENT,
    date TIMESTAMP NOT NULL,
    total_reviews INTEGER NOT NULL,
    avg_sentiment FLOAT NOT NULL,
    sentiment_distribution JSON NOT NULL,
    top_aspects JSON NOT NULL,
    created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP
);
```

### Sample Queries

#### 1. Insert a new review

```sql
INSERT INTO reviews (text, rating, source)
VALUES ('The battery life on this phone is amazing, but the camera quality is poor.', 3.5, 'manual');
```

#### 2. Retrieve a review with its analysis

```sql
SELECT r.id, r.text, r.rating, 
       sa.sentiment_score, sa.sentiment_label,
       rs.summary_text
FROM reviews r
LEFT JOIN sentiment_analyses sa ON r.id = sa.review_id
LEFT JOIN review_summaries rs ON r.id = rs.review_id
WHERE r.id = 1;
```

#### 3. Get aspect analyses for a review

```sql
SELECT aspect, sentiment_score, sentiment_label, relevant_text
FROM aspect_analyses
WHERE review_id = 1;
```

#### 4. Get sentiment trends over time

```sql
SELECT date, avg_sentiment, sentiment_distribution
FROM review_trends
ORDER BY date DESC
LIMIT 10;
```

### Data Storage Considerations

1. **Text Storage**: Review text is stored as-is to preserve the original content
2. **Sentiment Scores**: Stored as float values between -1 (negative) and 1 (positive)
3. **JSON Data**: Trend data uses JSON format to store complex structures
4. **Timestamps**: All records include creation timestamps for trend analysis

---

## ðŸ”¹ 5. Handling Fake Reviews & Random Texts

### Fake Review Detection

The application employs several strategies to identify potentially fake reviews:

#### 1. Sentiment-Rating Mismatch

- **Detection Method**: Compare the numerical rating with the sentiment detected in the text
- **Implementation**:
  ```python
  def detect_sentiment_mismatch(review):
      # Get the rating and sentiment
      rating = review.rating
      sentiment = review.sentiment_analysis.sentiment_score
      
      # Check for mismatches
      if rating and sentiment:  # Only if both exist
          if rating <= 2 and sentiment > 0.3:  # Low rating but positive text
              return True, "Low rating (â‰¤2) but positive sentiment detected"
          elif rating >= 4 and sentiment < -0.3:  # High rating but negative text
              return True, "High rating (â‰¥4) but negative sentiment detected"
      
      return False, None
  ```

#### 2. Marketing Language Detection

- **Detection Method**: Check for promotional phrases and excessive positive language
- **Implementation**:
  ```python
  def detect_marketing_language(text):
      # List of marketing phrases
      marketing_phrases = [
          "best product ever", "changed my life", "revolutionary",
          "groundbreaking", "miracle", "amazing deal", "limited time offer"
      ]
      
      # Check if any marketing phrase is in the text
      text_lower = text.lower()
      for phrase in marketing_phrases:
          if phrase in text_lower:
              return True, f"Marketing language detected: '{phrase}'"
      
      return False, None
  ```

#### 3. Repeated Phrase Detection

- **Detection Method**: Identify suspicious repetition of phrases
- **Implementation**:
  ```python
  def detect_repeated_phrases(text):
      # Tokenize into sentences
      doc = nlp(text)
      sentences = [sent.text.strip() for sent in doc.sents]
      
      # Count occurrences of each sentence
      sentence_counts = {}
      for sentence in sentences:
          if len(sentence) > 10:  # Only consider substantial sentences
              if sentence in sentence_counts:
                  sentence_counts[sentence] += 1
              else:
                  sentence_counts[sentence] = 1
      
      # Check for repetitions
      repeated = [s for s, count in sentence_counts.items() if count > 1]
      if repeated:
          return True, "Repeated phrases detected"
      
      return False, None
  ```

### Random Text Handling

The application can identify and respond appropriately to irrelevant or random inputs:

#### 1. Aspect Detection Check

- **Detection Method**: Verify if the text contains any product-related aspects
- **Implementation**:
  ```python
  def is_product_review(text):
      # Extract aspects
      aspects = aspect_service.extract_aspects(text)
      
      # If no aspects found, likely not a product review
      if not aspects:
          return False, "Your review seems irrelevant. Please provide meaningful feedback about the product."
      
      return True, None
  ```

#### 2. Minimum Content Check

- **Detection Method**: Ensure the review has sufficient content to analyze
- **Implementation**:
  ```python
  def has_sufficient_content(text):
      # Check text length
      if len(text.split()) < 5:
          return False, "Please provide a more detailed review for analysis."
      
      return True, None
  ```

#### 3. Response Generation

- **Implementation**:
  ```python
  @router.post("/analyze")
  def analyze_review(request: ReviewRequest):
      # Check if it's a valid product review
      is_valid, message = is_product_review(request.text)
      if not is_valid:
          return {"error": message, "valid": False}
      
      # Check if it has sufficient content
      has_content, message = has_sufficient_content(request.text)
      if not has_content:
          return {"error": message, "valid": False}
      
      # Proceed with normal analysis...
  ```

### User Feedback

When a fake review or random text is detected, the application provides clear feedback to the user:

1. **For Fake Reviews**: "This review appears to be suspicious due to [reason]. Please provide genuine feedback."
2. **For Random Texts**: "Your review seems irrelevant. Please provide meaningful feedback about the product."
3. **For Short Inputs**: "Please provide a more detailed review for analysis."

---

## ðŸ”¹ 6. Business Use Cases

### Customer Feedback Analysis

Businesses can use the application to gain insights from customer reviews:

#### 1. Sentiment Tracking Over Time

- **Use Case**: Monitor how customer sentiment changes over time
- **Implementation**: The application stores timestamps with all analyses, allowing for trend visualization
- **Business Value**: Identify periods of declining satisfaction and correlate with product changes or external events

#### 2. Product Improvement Identification

- **Use Case**: Identify specific aspects of products that need improvement
- **Implementation**: The aspect extraction feature highlights product features with negative sentiment
- **Business Value**: Prioritize product improvements based on customer feedback
- **Example**:
  ```
  Aspect: Battery life
  Sentiment: Negative (Score: -0.75)
  Relevant Text: "The battery drains too quickly, barely lasts half a day."
  ```

#### 3. Fake Review Detection
